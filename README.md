1. As a user, I want to see a main page with a title and dispalying four image of gods/godess in circles.
2. As a user, I want to see a button below the image of the god/godess
3. As a user, I want to see a new page which will be displayed after I click a photo of the god/godess.
  This will take me to a new page whcih will display info about the god/godess I have clicked on.
4. As a user, I would like to make a prayer so that the gods know I'm listening.  There will be a button
  which will be displayed next to the photo of the god/godess.
